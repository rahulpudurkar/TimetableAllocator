## Overview

The Timetable Allocator is an Android application that automates the process of creating and managing timetables for schools, colleges, and universities. It aims to minimize conflicts and maximize the efficient use of available resources, such as classrooms and teachers.

## Features

- **Automated Timetable Generation**: Automatically generate timetables based on input constraints and requirements.
- **Conflict Detection and Resolution**: Identify and resolve scheduling conflicts.
- **Customizable Constraints**: Define custom constraints such as teacher availability, room capacities, and class durations.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface for managing and viewing timetables.
- **Scalability**: Handle large datasets and multiple constraints efficiently.

## Installation

To run the Timetable Allocator on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahulpudurkar/TimetableAllocator.git
   cd TimetableAllocator
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**:
   - Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project."
   - Navigate to the cloned repository directory and open it.

3. **Build the Project**:
   - Let Android Studio download and configure the necessary dependencies.
   - Once the project is set up, build the project to ensure everything is configured correctly.

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Connect an Android device or start an Android emulator.
   - Run the application from Android Studio.

## Usage

1. **Input Data**:
   - Prepare your input data for teachers, classrooms, and subjects.
   - Input the data into the application using the provided forms and interfaces.

2. **Generate Timetable**:
   - Use the application interface to generate the timetable based on your inputs and constraints.
   - The generated timetable will be displayed within the app.

3. **View and Edit Timetable**:
   - The timetable can be viewed in a user-friendly format within the app.
   - You can edit specific entries if necessary to resolve conflicts or make adjustments.

## Configuration

The system is highly configurable. You can update the settings directly within the app:

- **Teacher Availability**: Specify the availability of each teacher.
- **Room Capacities**: Define the capacity of each classroom.
- **Class Durations**: Set the duration for each class period.

## Algorithm

The Timetable Allocator uses a combination of heuristic and optimization algorithms to ensure efficient and conflict-free timetable generation. The main steps of the algorithm include:

1. **Constraint Gathering**: Collect all necessary constraints and requirements.
2. **Initial Allocation**: Perform an initial allocation of classes to time slots and rooms.
3. **Conflict Detection**: Identify any conflicts in the initial allocation.
4. **Optimization**: Adjust the allocation to resolve conflicts and optimize resource usage.
5. **Finalization**: Finalize the timetable and display it in the app.
